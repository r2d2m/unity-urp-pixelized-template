Hello r2d2m, could you please make this repository private? 

I am the author of the base repo and I accidentally published a version that contained a paid and licensed product, which exists publicly here in this fork, and shows up when you search for the product in GitHub.
please help me protect the original author's work and make this repository private. 

I hope you can understand and will help me correct my mistake. Thank you.
